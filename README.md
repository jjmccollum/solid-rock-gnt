## Basic Information
This is the official GitHub repository for the Greek New Testament published by Solid Rock Publications. The current edition of this text is compiled on Byzantine priority principles and is very close in character to the Robinson-Pierpont text hosted at https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text. As the apparatus details differences between our edition and other editions, rather than actual manuscripts, it is not a true "critical apparatus," and accordingly, the Solid Rock Greek New Testament in its current form is not strictly a "critical text." Rather, the main goal of this edition is to provide the community with a basis of comparison between the state of the art and various historical methodologies in New Testament textual criticism.
We feel that this goal is best achieved through making our work freely available to anyone interested in using or expanding it. While printed copies of the text with and without the apparatus are available for purchase through Amazon and other vendors (and all support is appreciated!), the files for the text and textual apparatus will be stored here and maintained to incorporate minor edits and corrections between major releases. The text and apparatus are stored in separate files, each formatted to maximize readability and ease of use.
